    "## Introduction to Extensions on Omniverse\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions in Omniverse are additional software components that can be added to the platform to provide additional functionality and capabilities. These extensions are designed to enhance the user experience and provide users with specialized tools and workflows that are tailored to specific industries or use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common types of extensions available for Omniverse include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asset management tools**: These extensions provide users with the ability to manage large and complex projects more efficiently, including importing and exporting assets, organizing assets, and tracking changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration tools**: These extensions allow users to work collaboratively with other team members in real-time, including sharing and reviewing 3D content, and communicating with team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-time editing capabilities**: These extensions enable users to make real-time edits to 3D content, including making changes to materials, textures, and lighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation tools**: These extensions provide users with simulation capabilities, including physics-based simulations and AI-driven simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, extensions in Omniverse provide users with a wide range of tools and capabilities that enable them to create, simulate, and collaborate on 3D content with greater efficiency and flexibility. These extensions can help users unlock the full potential of the platform and create more compelling and engaging 3D content. Let us now get started by building a simple extension in Omniverse."
